I am a Doctoral researcher in the Information & Computer Sciences department at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. Prior to this role, I completed my MSc in Information and Communication Technology - Smart Systems at the University of Turku (UTU) in Finland. You can read my MSc thesis here. My research interests lie at the intersection of healthcare, human-centered computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and data science. I am interested in applying these methods to a variety of healthcare problems. The Hawaii Digital Health Lab is located at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
