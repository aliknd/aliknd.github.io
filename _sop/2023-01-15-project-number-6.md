excerpt: 'Based on an EMA based intervention, this study intends to use all modalities to efficiently recognize stress, a commonly experienced emotional state. The study will involve collecting data (visual, speech, text, and time series) from participants for a month and then analyzing the data to identify the key features associated with accurately recognizing stress and anxiety.'

Implement a smartphone app for STress and ANxiety Detection (STAND) to be used in a study that aims to gather users’ stress and anxiety data whilst they play cognitively challenging and stimulating games.

The users’ faces are recorded while playing these games, and these recordings will be used as training data for an AI model that will be able to detect stress and anxiety and estimate their corresponding levels.

This stage of the project focuses on continuing development for pre-existing features of the app, as well as augment the gamification aspect to enhance the user experience.
1. Upload all recorded videos to AWS, where it can be analyzed
2. Incentivize users to log in frequently with daily rewards and a weekly leaderboard
3. The addition of a second, stress-inducing game to gather more data
