Key features

- EMA check-ins (2 steps, <1 min): Supports both notification-triggered EMAs and self-initiated logs (“I just smoked!”). Either can fill scheduled slots; self-logs outside a slot are marked extra and may earn reduced/no stars per study rules.
- Smart notifications with rotating motivation: Local prompts run between Wake–Sleep with varied motivational messages. Catch-up reminders continue if the daily minimum isn’t met (2 smoking + 2 non-smoking, configurable).
- Daily progress & quotas: Segmented progress bar plus Smoking / Non-smoking meters and counts.
- Rewards + motivational success modal: Star awards reflect slot-filling vs. extra entries and grant daily bonuses when minimums are met. Milestones (e.g., first self-log, first full day, 7-day completion, streak thresholds, quota streaks) trigger bonus ⭐, a badge-style callout with celebratory animation in the modal, and are saved to the Rewards view.
- Weekly insights: 7-day bar chart, “Best time” to log, and 7-day completion %.
- Streaks: Current streak with a one-day grace rule, 8-week heatmap, and last-7-days list.
- Progress details: Today’s timeline (Completed / Missed / Upcoming) plus a Self-logged section indicating which entries counted vs extra.
- Records & export: “My Records” lets users export detailed EMA logs to CSV.
- Preferences: Wake/Sleep editor instantly recalculates today’s plan and reschedules prompts.
- Deep links & reliability: Tapping a notification opens straight to the EMA; time-zone aware, and screens auto-refresh on new submissions.
