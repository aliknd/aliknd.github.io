Background:
Artificial intelligence (AI)â€“powered digital therapies that detect methamphetamine cravings via consumer devices have the potential to reduce health care disparities by providing remote and accessible care solutions to communities with limited care solutions, such as Native Hawaiian, Filipino, and Pacific Islander communities. However, Native Hawaiian, Filipino, and Pacific Islander communities are understudied with respect to digital therapeutics and AI health sensing despite using technology at the same rates as other racial groups.

Objective:
In this study, we aimed to understand the feasibility of continuous remote digital monitoring and ecological momentary assessments in Native Hawaiian, Filipino, and Pacific Islander communities in Hawaii by curating a novel data set of longitudinal Fitbit (Fitbit Inc) biosignals with the corresponding craving and substance use labels. We also aimed to develop personalized AI models that predict methamphetamine craving events in real time using wearable sensor data.

Methods:
We will develop personalized AI and machine learning models for methamphetamine use and craving prediction in 40 individuals from Native Hawaiian, Filipino, and Pacific Islander communities by curating a novel data set of real-time Fitbit biosensor readings and the corresponding participant annotations (ie, raw self-reported substance use data) of their methamphetamine use and cravings. In the process of collecting this data set, we will gain insights into cultural and other human factors that can challenge the proper acquisition of precise annotations. With the resulting data set, we will use self-supervised learning AI approaches, which are a new family of machine learning methods that allows a neural network to be trained without labels by being optimized to make predictions about the data. The inputs to the proposed AI models are Fitbit biosensor readings, and the outputs are predictions of methamphetamine use or craving. This paradigm is gaining increased attention in AI for health care.

Results:
To date, more than 40 individuals have expressed interest in participating in the study, and we have successfully recruited our first 5 participants with minimal logistical challenges and proper compliance. Several logistical challenges that the research team has encountered so far and the related implications are discussed.

Conclusions:
We expect to develop models that significantly outperform traditional supervised methods by finetuning according to the data of a participant. Such methods will enable AI solutions that work with the limited data available from Native Hawaiian, Filipino, and Pacific Islander populations and that are inherently unbiased owing to their personalized nature. Such models can support future AI-powered digital therapeutics for substance abuse.
