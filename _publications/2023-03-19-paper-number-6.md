Emotions play an essential role in human communication. Developing computer vision models for automatic recognition of emotion expression can aid in a variety of domains, including robotics, digital behavioral healthcare, and media analytics. There are three types of emotional representations which are traditionally modeled in affective computing research: Action Units, Valence Arousal (VA), and Categorical Emotions. As part of an effort to move beyond these representations towards more fine-grained labels, we describe our submission to the newly introduced Emotional Reaction Intensity (ERI) Estimation challenge in the 5th competition for Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW). We developed four deep neural networks trained in the visual domain and a multimodal model trained with both visual and audio features to predict emotion reaction intensity. Our best performing model on the Hume-Reaction dataset achieved an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.4080 on the test set using a pre-trained ResNet50 model. This work provides a first step towards the development of production-grade models which predict emotion reaction intensities rather than discrete emotion categories.
